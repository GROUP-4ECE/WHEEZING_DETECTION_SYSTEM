# WHEEZING_DETECTION_SYSTEM-


---
>### Abstract ###
 These days the number of people suffering from respiratory diseases like asthma and other diseases are increasing dat by day.
 One of the main reason for it is the high level of air polution. Even if we control the polution there will be a big number 
 of people suffering due to its after effects. This a project started with the aim of early detection and getting early treatment 
 for such people. Here we are using a dataset consist of a lot of lung sounds which has wheezing and non wheezing elements, to 
 train the model which uses MFCC  to extract features from them. Then it uses SVM algorithm. After it is trained then an external
 input lung sound is given to it to predict if this sound is wheezing or not.
